A friend said I am a traditional person intrinsically somehow with an attempt to break the invisible shackles, the boundary of the traditional and the nontraditional. I know it's true for I am raised and influenced since my juvenile in such family and society.<!--more-->  
  
Let's define the word "traditional" with the meaning of life styles with or close to Eastern world, and the word "nontraditional" with the opposite one.  
  
With thousands years' culture of the doctrine of the mean in Eastern world, it would be so easy about choosing just like an objective question, following the tide and keeping away from too leftward or too rightward. It is also believed safe and reliable. If I am always as pure as a plain paper about my mind, there would be never so troublesome.  
  
If comparing the modes of thinking as a curve of Normal Distribution, the curve in the Eastern world is supposed to be steep and thin while the curve in the Western world is supposed to be flat and fat, that is the difference. Persons' innate thoughts and exterior activities in the two environments are pulled or pushed from the two types of curve.
  
No readings, no worries. Especially when reading so many books about different life styles, thoughts, viewpoints and experiences of this flat world, notions' sparking and colliding in the consciousness. While endeavoring to experience colorful diversities of life, the farther you deviate, the stronger viscous forces pull you back to the curve. (Based on the theory of evolution, it would take tens or hundreds of generations to have a thorough change, of that curve, for the whole society.) And I also believe, it's true.  
  
Retrospecting myself, what I would like to do is exploring this magnificent earth by reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles. Only after that, I could have a proper state of mind to choose and settle down. I would like to live a fresh and unique myself without considering what the general trends' choices. Obviously that's the reason  I am who I am. I would try to make some tiny changes within an invisible scope, the so-called margin of safety. As for others, I would be not so sure. Maybe that, the flounder, is some proof of my youth.
