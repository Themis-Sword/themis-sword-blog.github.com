A friend said I am a traditional person intrinsically somehow with an attempt to break the invisible shackles, the boundary of the traditional and the nontraditional. I know it's true for I am raised and influenced since my juvenile in such family.<!--more-->  
  
Let's define the word "traditional" with the meaning of life styles with or close to Eastern world, and the word "nontraditional" with the opposite one.  
  
With thousands years' culture of the doctrine of the mean in Eastern world, it would be so easy about choosing just like an objective question, following the tide and keeping away from too leftward or too rightward. It is also believed safe and reliable. If I am always as pure as a plain paper about my mind, there would be never so troublesome.  
  
If comparing the modes of thinking as a curve of Normal Distribution, the curve in the Eastern world is supposed to be steep and the curve in the Western world is supposed to be flat, that is the difference. Persons' innate thoughts and exterior activities in the two environments are pulled or pushed from the two types of curve.
  
No readings, no worries. Especially when reading so many books about different life styles, thoughts, viewpoints and experiences of this flat world, notions' sparking and colliding in the consciousness.
