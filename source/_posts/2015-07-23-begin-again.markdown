####LOST STARS

Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies  
Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see  
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow  
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand  
I'd be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow  
So let's get drunk on our tears and  
  
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?  
  
Who are we?  
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?  
Woe is me,  
if we're not careful turns into reality  
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow  
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer  
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending  
Where we're dancing in our tears and  
  
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?  
  
I thought I saw you out there crying  
I thought I heard you call my name  
I thought I heard you out there crying  
Just the same  
  
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?  
  
I thought I saw you out there crying  
I thought I heard you call my name  
I thought I heard you out there crying  
  
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?  
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
