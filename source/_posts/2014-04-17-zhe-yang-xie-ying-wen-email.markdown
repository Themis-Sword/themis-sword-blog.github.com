**1. 郵件的開頭**  
感謝讀者是郵件開場白的好辦法。感謝您的讀者能讓對方感到高興，特別是之後你有事相求的情況下會很有幫助。  
  
Thank you for contacting us.如果有人寫信來詢問公司的服務，就可以使用這句句子開頭。向他們對公司的興趣表示感謝。  
  
Thank you for your prompt reply.當一個客戶或是同事很快就回復了你的郵件，一定記得要感謝他們。如果回復並不及時，只要將“prompt”除去即可，你還可以說，“Thank you for getting back to me.”<!--more-->  
  
Thank you for providing the requested information.如果你詢問某人一些信息，他們花了點時間才發送給你，那就用這句句子表示你仍然對他們的付出表示感激。  
  
Thank you for all your assistance.如果有人給了你特別的幫助，那一定要感謝他們！如果你想對他們表示特別的感激，就用這個句子，“I truly appreciate … your help in resolving the problem.”Thank you raising your concerns.   
  
就算某個客戶或是經理寫郵件給你對你的工作提出了一定的質疑，你還是要感謝他們。這樣你能表現出你對他們的認真態度表示尊重及感激。同時，你也可以使用，“Thank you for your feedback.”  
  
**2. 郵件的結尾**   
在郵件開頭表示感謝一般是表示對對方過去付出的感謝，而在郵件結尾處表示感謝是對將來的幫助表示感謝。事先表示感謝，能讓對方在行動時更主動更樂意。  
  
Thank you for your kind cooperation.如果你需要讀者幫助你做某事，那就先得表示感謝。  
  
Thank you for your attention to this matter.與以上的類似，本句包含了你對對方將來可能的幫助表示感謝。  
  
Thank you for your understanding.如果你寫到任何會對讀者產生負面影響的內容那就使用這句句子吧。  
  
Thank you for your consideration.如果您是在尋求機會或是福利，例如你在求職的話，就用這封郵件結尾。  
  
Thank you again for everything you've done.這句句子可以用在結尾，和以上有所不同。如果你在郵件開頭已經謝過了讀者，你就可以使用這句話，但是因為他們的幫助，你可以著重再次感謝你們的付出。
