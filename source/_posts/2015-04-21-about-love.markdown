*Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrival's gate at Heathrow airport. General opinion start to make out that we live in a world of hatred and greed. But I don't see that, seems to me that love is everywhere. Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy, but it's always there, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriend, girlfriend, old friends. When the plane hit the Twin Tower, as far as I know, none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge. They are all messages of love. If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling that love actually is all around.*

*I have to tell you this and you need to hear it. I've loved you since I met you... But I wouldn't allow myself to truly feel it until today. I was always thinking ahead. Making decisions out of fear. Today, because of what I learned from you... every choice I made was different and my life has completely changed. And I've learned that if you do that, you're living your life fully. It doesn't matter if you have five minutes or fifty years. Samantha, if not for today, if not for you... I would never have known love at all. So thank you for being the person who taught me to love, and to be loved.*  	  
**--"If Only" (Movie, 2004')**  
  
    
*The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the Ocean,
The winds of Heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one spirit meet and mingle,
Why not I with thine?*
	
*See the mountains kiss high Heaven
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdained its brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea;
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?*  
**--"Love's Philosophy" (Percy Bysshe Shelley, 1820')**
  
    
*Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments. Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O no; it is an ever-fixed mark, 
That looks on tempests, and is never shaken;
It is the star to every wandering bark,
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks 
Within his bending sickle's compass come; 
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
If this be error and upon me proved,
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.*   
**--"Sonnet 116" (Shakespeare, 1609')**
  
  
Love is not a word, it is a state of mind  
Love is beyond a promise, it is a belief  
Love is hope, it is also fortitude  
Love makes a little green, but not so jealous  
Love leads to a colorful dream, which is worth weaving and cherishing  
Love means tolerating, which permits you being real  
Love paints your life, furthermore harbors your soul.  
Love is so hard to achieve, but it trully lasts.  
**--"About Love" (Themis_Sword, 2015')**
