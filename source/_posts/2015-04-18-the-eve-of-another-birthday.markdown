I almost forgot how old I am this year.  
  
Thanks my parents for their affectionate SMS this morning wishing me a happy birthday and take-care overseas alone. 
  
Actually, I might be solitary in a way rather than lonely.<!--more-->   
  
Retrospecting, It seems like I even don't tolerate continuing the "insipid and mundane" life traces no matter in which city of China. The gap between the so-called "dream" and reality keeps on tearing. I am kind of negative for picking that apple always higher despite my leaping and attempting. So I chose to leave(flounder) and chase a new style sitting in a classroom as a postgraduate student, overseas. There would be other choices for sure, nevertheless, I also need some fresh air.   
  
Adaptability would never be an issue for me in the last ten years since my admission to university away from hometown without regarding to geographical position nor language speaking. So I live well for now, or, in other words, I survive well, for not self-sufficient.  
  
I'm trying to stay hungary and foolish, so I study and review knowledge almost everyday without any passion of social networkings nor outdoor activities. Meanwhile, the efficiency of learning is not so satisfactory, frankly. The more materials or resources I consult, the more self-ignorant I feel, which is so frustrated. I could recall a professor's words **"Time Is the Only Enemy!"** on the registration day.  
  
It doesn't mean living in a vacuum while no comparing with others' gains. Especially I'm nothing but a student on the margin of my twenties. I remind myself that actually I am gaining much, in mental.  
  
Thankfully, our transnational love evolves smoothly. As my motivity to move on so fearlessly, she is fabulous. Feeling comforting and cozy with her so much. Weaving our dreams and moreover, we are struggling, inch by inch, towards the brilliant future of ours.  
  
It would be only quite an ordinary day of tomorrow, as for me, I'd rather consider it another stair up.
