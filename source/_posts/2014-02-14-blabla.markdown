*More than four months of the state between jobs becomes a torture.*  
  
Retrospecting my travel itinerary last year from Thai to South Korea, nearly 50 days in eight countries and districts, I know, traveling is indispensable in my life notwithstanding being not the life itself.<!--more-->   

Actually, I love challenges no matter in travel or in real life, especially from emotions and work. The point is that future is worth expecting and exploring.
  
Watching kinds of TV series, reading books, reviewing English vocabularies, learning Python, celebrating Chinese Spring Festival... I might feel a hallucination of time's fleeing.  

So a new spring has come already.  

I believe I am lost, in an deserted corner of the world.  

Though it feels no worse, please cheer up! I urgently need a fresh air and a breakthrough.
