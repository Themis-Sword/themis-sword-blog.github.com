**"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish."** Such resounding words delivered by Steve Jobs were in 2005 Stanford Commencement Address which, was actually not the topic today. The quote is just about some reflections of a movie [*Groundhog Day*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/).<!--more-->  
  
**"What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?"**  
  
Phil Connors, the hero in that movie, an arrogant and egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during a disgusted assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. After indulging in periods of hedonism, dismay, bitterness, despair then numerous suicide attempts, he begins to re-examine his life and try to change -- improving and enriching himself.  
   
Some plots are interesting that when Phil tries harder and harder to cater to someone, either terrible consequences come or void even he succeeds. It might be because Phil attempts to alter the original himself which he actually couldn't. Such alternation would not last long even though he makes it for a flash. Only when Phil accepts the circumstances calmly, patiently and ready to do some "changes" would he handle the "magic" to break such time loop.  
  
And so is the story telling us.  
  
In real life, things are so similar that few ones are satisfied with their presents living roughly the same days over and over and over again. Sorrowfully that only fewer ones would like to make a change as to be sluggish, revolted and desperate dying finally.  
  
Never scared, even if looks like a deserted weeds. Just endeavor, struggle, enrich oneself, only for the moment to handle that magic to break own "time loop".
