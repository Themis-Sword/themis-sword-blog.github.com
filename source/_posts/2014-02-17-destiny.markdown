If it's meant to be, it will be.  
  
Most things in the life seem to be predestined. Emotion, fortunes, jobs... No idea when it would burst into your life rather than when it would be going to vanish.<!--more-->  
  
You are always desperate and hopeless when you are insulated from love or career you urgently desired days and nights.  
  
Hallucination comes then, talks to yourself you are abandoned. Your doubt the Lord leaves you uncared even omitted. 
  
Some grieving emotions aroused as patients are told to face with impending death -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Maybe the stages evolves faster than the instance, however, someone are so easy to fall into the abyss of self-denial (rather than condition-denial) and
 accept you yourself are indeed a loser afterwards giving up even not trying once again.  
  
Actually, there would be always alternatives, getting armed, with everything you could access to, to fulfill yourself.  
  
Just like the saying "Opportunity favors only the prepared mind". Not to emphasize you would surely get the chance when prepared. Instead, a prepared one is easier to grasp the fortune.  
  
Watching the videos **Paul Potts** and **Susan Boyle** of ***Britain's Talent Show*** again, undoubtedly bursting into tears another time. No one is easy to impress others.  
  
What you could do is getting prepared and show, the whole world would make way for that. Besides, don't let the passing time agitated you referring to the conception of “sunk cost”.
  
So, be a man, and you will enjoy it!
