<p>If it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be.</p>

<p>Most things in the life seem to be predestined. Emotion, fortunes, jobs&hellip; No idea when it would burst into your life rather than when it would be going to vanish.<!--more--></p>

<p>You are always desperate and hopeless when you are insulated from love or career you urgently desired days and nights.</p>

<p>Hallucination comes then, talks to yourself you are abandoned. Your doubt the Lord leaves you uncared even omitted.</p>

<p>Some grieving emotions aroused as patients are told to face with impending death &mdash; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Maybe the stages evolves faster than the instance, however, someone are so easy to fall into the abyss of self-denial (rather than condition-denial) and
 accept you yourself are indeed a loser afterwards giving up even not trying once again.</p>

<p>Actually, the period is for you to rest, retrospect, think, and be improved. The best strategy is getting armed, with everything you could access to, to enrich yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the saying &ldquo;Opportunity favors only the prepared mind&rdquo;. Not to emphasize you would surely get the chance when prepared. Instead, a prepared one is easier to grasp the fortune.</p>

<p>Watching the videos <em>Paul Potts</em> and <em>Susan Boyle</em> of <em>Britain&rsquo;s Talent Show</em> again, undoubtedly bursting into tears another time. No one is easy to impress others.</p>

<p>Getting prepared and showing, the whole world would make way for you. Besides, don&rsquo;t let the passing time agitated you referring to the conception of “sunk cost”.</p>

<p>Well, be a man, and you will enjoy it! So, if it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be, only when you are prepared.</p>
