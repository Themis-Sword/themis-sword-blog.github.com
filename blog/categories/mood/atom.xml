<p>A friend said I am a traditional person intrinsically somehow with an attempt to break the invisible shackles, the boundary of the traditional and the nontraditional. I know it&rsquo;s true for I am raised and influenced since my juvenile in such family and society.<!--more--></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s define the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; with the meaning of life styles with or close to Eastern world, and the word &ldquo;nontraditional&rdquo; with the opposite one.</p>

<p>With thousands years' culture of the doctrine of the mean in Eastern world, it would be so easy about choosing just like an objective question, following the tide and keeping away from too leftward or too rightward. It is also believed safe and reliable. If I am always as pure as a plain paper about my mind, there would be never so troublesome.</p>

<p>If comparing the modes of thinking as a curve of Normal Distribution, the curve in the Eastern world is supposed to be steep and thin while the curve in the Western world is supposed to be flat and fat, that is the difference. Persons' innate thoughts and exterior activities in the two environments are pulled or pushed from the two types of curve.</p>

<p>No readings, no worries. Especially when reading so many books about different life styles, thoughts, viewpoints and experiences of this flat world, notions' sparking and colliding in the consciousness. While endeavoring to experience colorful diversities of life, the farther you deviate, the stronger viscous forces pull you back to the curve. (Based on the theory of evolution, it would take tens or hundreds of generations to have a thorough change, of that curve, for the whole society.) And I also believe, it&rsquo;s true.</p>

<p>Retrospecting myself, what I would like to do is exploring this magnificent earth by reading thousands of books and traveling thousands of miles. Only after that, I could have a proper state of mind to choose and settle down. I would like to live a fresh and unique myself without considering what the general trends' choices. Obviously that&rsquo;s the reason  I am who I am. I would try to make some tiny changes within an invisible scope, the so-called margin of safety. As for others, I would be not so sure. Maybe that, the flounder, is some proof of my youth.</p>

<p>I hurt myself today<br/>
To see if I still feel  <!--more-->
I focus on the pain<br/>
The only thing that&rsquo;s real<br/>
The needle tears a hole<br/>
The old familiar sting<br/>
Try to kill it all away<br/>
But I remember everything</p>

<p>What have I become<br/>
My sweetest friend<br/>
Everyone I know goes away<br/>
In the end<br/>
And you could have it all<br/>
My empire of dirt<br/>
I will let you down<br/>
I will make you hurt</p>

<p>I wear this crown of thorns<br/>
Upon my liar&rsquo;s chair<br/>
Full of broken thoughts<br/>
I cannot repair<br/>
Beneath the stains of time<br/>
The feelings disappear<br/>
You are someone else<br/>
I am still right here</p>

<p>What have I become<br/>
My sweetest friend<br/>
Everyone I know goes away<br/>
In the end<br/>
And you could have it all<br/>
My empire of dirt<br/>
I will let you down<br/>
I will make you hurt</p>

<p>If I could start again<br/>
A million miles away<br/>
I would keep myself<br/>
I would find a way</p>

<p><strong>What would remain imperishably while lines' etching on the face? A word, some memories, or just serenity with or without regret.</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a whole month working in a new company, which is a venture company with the area of distributed storage focused.<!--more--></p>

<p>Returning back to Beijing after half a year&rsquo;s separation, living in a high-rise apartment, I soon realized, it would be a new way.</p>

<p>Everything&rsquo;s changed whereas everything seems the same.</p>

<p>NEW CHALLENGES come with the new position. Studying and reading fulfill every day and almost every minute, that joys me. I could see vigor&rsquo;s back and fresh air&rsquo;s pervading.</p>

<p>Time to transform and evolve.</p>

<p>如果你的內心有不安<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying your restlessness in your heart,<!--more--><br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
如果你的眼中有對夢想的渴望<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying the flames of dreams in your eyes,<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
像一陣風一般的自由生活<br/>
Like a gust of wind, learn to live free<br/>
學著像大海的波浪般流動<br/>
Learn to flow like the waves that make a sea<br/>
張開你的雙臂擁抱每個時刻，你都可能收獲一份問候<br/>
May every moment gift you a new sight to greet<br/>
如果你的眼中有期望<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying wonder in your eyes,<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
如果你的內心有不安<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying your restlessness in your heart<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/stayhsf.png"><br/>
<strong>&ldquo;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish.&rdquo;</strong> Such resounding words delivered by Steve Jobs in 2005 Stanford Commencement Address which, was actually not the topic today. The quote is just about some reflections of a movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/"><em>Groundhog Day</em></a>.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Phil Connors, the hero in that movie, an arrogant and egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during a disgusted assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. After indulging in periods of hedonism, dismay, bitterness, despair then numerous suicide attempts, he begins to re-examine his life and tries to change &mdash; improving and enriching himself through learning new skills and helping people.</p>

<p>Some plots are interesting that when Phil tries harder and harder to cater to someone he is interested, either terrible consequences(such as slaps on his face) come or void&rsquo;s arising even he succeeds. It might be because Phil attempts to alter the original himself which he actually couldn&rsquo;t. Such alternation would not last long even though he makes it for a flash. Only when Phil accepts the circumstances calmly, patiently and ready to do some &ldquo;changes&rdquo; would he handle the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; to break such time loop and win his queen&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>And so is the story telling us.</p>

<p>In real life, things are so similar that few ones are satisfied with their presents living roughly the same days over and over and over again. Senses of helplessness and so far as abomination towards their own never vanish. Sorrowfully that only fewer ones would like or dare to make a change as to be sluggish, revolted and desperate dying finally.</p>

<p>Staying hungry and foolish, is only for adequate constant advances for the nature of oneself could not be changed but the substance. There would be one and the only way to get rid of such suck life rhythm is to get cultured. Never scared, even if looked like deserted weeds temporarily. Just endeavor, struggle, enrich oneself, waiting patiently for the moment handling that fabulous magic to break one&rsquo;s own &ldquo;time loop&rdquo;.</p>
