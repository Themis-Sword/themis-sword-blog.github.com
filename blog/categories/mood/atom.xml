<p>If it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be.</p>

<p>Most things in the life seem to be predestined. Emotion, fortunes, jobs&hellip; No idea when it would burst into your life rather than when it would be going to vanish.<!--more--></p>

<p>You are always desperate and hopeless when you are insulated from love or career you urgently desired days and nights.</p>

<p>Hallucination comes then, talks to yourself you are abandoned. Your doubt the Lord leaves you uncared even omitted.</p>

<p>Some grieving emotions aroused as patients are told to face with impending death &mdash; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Maybe the stages evolves faster than the instance, however, someone are so easy to fall into the abyss of self-denial (rather than condition-denial) and
 accept you yourself are indeed a loser afterwards giving up even not trying once again.</p>

<p>Actually, there would be always alternatives, getting armed, with everything you could access to, to fulfill yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the saying &ldquo;Opportunity favors only the prepared mind&rdquo;. Not to emphasize you would surely get the chance when prepared. Instead, a prepared one is easier to grasp the fortune.</p>

<p>Watching the videos <strong>Paul Potts</strong> and <strong>Susan Boyle</strong> of <strong><em>Britain&rsquo;s Talent Show</em></strong> again, undoubtedly bursting into tears another time. No one is easy to impress others.</p>

<p>What you could do is getting prepared and show, the whole world would make way for that. Besides, don&rsquo;t let the passing time agitated you referring to the conception of “sunk cost”.</p>

<p>Well, be a man, and you will enjoy it! So, if it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be, only when you are prepared.</p>

<p><strong>It becomes a torture which the state between-jobs' lasting more than four months.</strong></p>

<p>Retrospecting my travel itinerary last year from Thai to South Korea, nearly 50 days across eight countries and districts, I know, traveling is indispensable in my life notwithstanding being not the life itself.<!--more--></p>

<p>Actually, I love challenges no matter in travel or in daily life, especially from emotions and work. The point is that future is worth expecting and exploring.</p>

<p>Watching kinds of TV series, reading books, reviewing English vocabularies, learning Python, celebrating Chinese Spring Festival&hellip; I might feel a hallucination of time&rsquo;s fleeing.</p>

<p>So a new spring has come already.</p>

<p>I believe I am lost, in a deserted corner of the world.</p>

<p>Though it feels no worse, please cheer up! I urgently need a fresh air and a breakthrough.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong><br/>
Happy Lantern Festival and single&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day!</p>
