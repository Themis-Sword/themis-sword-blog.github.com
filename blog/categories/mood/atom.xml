<p>It&rsquo;s been a whole month working in a new company, which is a venture company with the area of distributed storage focused.<!--more--></p>

<p>Returning back to Beijing after half a year&rsquo;s separation, living in a high-rise apartment, I soon realized, it would be a new way.</p>

<p>Everything&rsquo;s changed whereas everything seems the same.</p>

<p>NEW CHALLENGES come with the new position. Studying and reading fulfill every day and almost every minute, that joys me. I could see vigor&rsquo;s back and fresh air&rsquo;s pervading.</p>

<p>Time to transform and evolve.</p>

<p>如果你的內心有不安<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying your restlessness in your heart,<!--more--><br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
如果你的眼中有對夢想的渴望<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying the flames of dreams in your eyes,<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
像一陣風一般的自由生活<br/>
Like a gust of wind, learn to live free<br/>
學著像大海的波浪般流動<br/>
Learn to flow like the waves that make a sea<br/>
張開你的雙臂擁抱每個時刻，你都可能收獲一份問候<br/>
May every moment gift you a new sight to greet<br/>
如果你的眼中有期望<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying wonder in your eyes,<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive<br/>
如果你的內心有不安<br/>
If you&rsquo;re carrying your restlessness in your heart<br/>
那麽你還活著<br/>
you are alive</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/stayhsf.png"><br/>
<strong>&ldquo;Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish.&rdquo;</strong> Such resounding words delivered by Steve Jobs were in 2005 Stanford Commencement Address which, was actually not the topic today. The quote is just about some reflections of a movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/"><em>Groundhog Day</em></a>.<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>Phil Connors, the hero in that movie, an arrogant and egocentric Pittsburgh TV weatherman who, during a disgusted assignment covering the annual Groundhog Day event in Punxsutawney, finds himself in a time loop, repeating the same day over and over and over again. After indulging in periods of hedonism, dismay, bitterness, despair then numerous suicide attempts, he begins to re-examine his life and tries to change &mdash; improving and enriching himself through learning new skills and helping people.</p>

<p>Some plots are interesting that when Phil tries harder and harder to cater to someone he is interested, either terrible consequences(such as slaps on his face) come or void&rsquo;s arising even he succeeds. It might be because Phil attempts to alter the original himself which he actually couldn&rsquo;t. Such alternation would not last long even though he makes it for a flash. Only when Phil accepts the circumstances calmly, patiently and ready to do some &ldquo;changes&rdquo; would he handle the &ldquo;magic&rdquo; to break such time loop and win his queen&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>And so is the story telling us.</p>

<p>In real life, things are so similar that few ones are satisfied with their presents living roughly the same days over and over and over again. Senses of helplessness and so far as abomination towards their own never vanish. Sorrowfully that only fewer ones would like or dare to make a change as to be sluggish, revolted and desperate dying finally.</p>

<p>Staying hungry and foolish, is only for adequate constant advances for the nature of oneself could not be changed but the substance. There would be one and the only way to get rid of such suck life rhythm is to get cultured. Never scared, even if looked like deserted weeds temporarily. Just endeavor, struggle, enrich oneself, waiting patiently for the moment handling that fabulous magic to break one&rsquo;s own &ldquo;time loop&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Leaves sway down in sough late autumn winds, desolately, fading away, without one single sign.<!--more--></p>

<p>Fortunately trees' remaining vigor, notwithstanding in months' hibernation, new shoots would be pushing out after austere winters eventually.</p>

<p>Be hopeful and persistent, even through quite tough time, leastways&mdash;an opportunity to blossom.</p>

<p>The distance between life and death, might be far beyond the real boundary from life and death.<!--more--></p>

<p>It might need only one second separating fresh teary faces from pale freezing corpses. Or, seventeen days' passing eclipse infinite dread and heart-lacerating sorrow over these pathetic waiting families who have already withstood too much.</p>

<p>Time is a queer thing could not be explained reasonably which gives people shock, sadness, hope then and despair finally.</p>

<p>Since March 8th, no solid wreckages of MH370 are found yet. Maybe we would never find the aircraft. However, things become weird and bizarre thanks to kinds of press conferences, analyses, information from so-called concerned third parties. Emotions of the whole nation are affected like riding on the roller coasters, let alone the relatives.</p>

<p>The latest news, came unexpectedly without any warmth of humanity. A text message sending to relatives of the passengers onboard says that &ldquo;we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those onboard survived.&rdquo; Maybe the planes was ended in the remote Southern Indian Ocean for it is &ldquo;far from any possible landing sites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cannot imagine those relatives' heartbreak.</p>

<p>Lives are so fragile that any good bye would become a farewell forever.</p>

<p>Please pray for the living, and mourn over the passing. Cherish every single moment sharing with your beloved. Treat life well.</p>
