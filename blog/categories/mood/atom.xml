<p>The distance between life and death, might be far beyond the real boundary from life and death.<!--more--></p>

<p>It might need only one second separating fresh teary faces from pale freezing corpses. Or, seventeen days' passing eclipse infinite dread and heart-lacerating sorrow over these pathetic waiting families who have already withstood too much.</p>

<p>Time is a queer thing could not be explained reasonably which gives people shock, sadness, hope then and despair finally.</p>

<p>Since March 8th, no solid wreckages of MH370 are found yet. Maybe we would never find the aircraft. However, things become weird and bizarre thanks to kinds of press conferences, analyses, information from so-called concerned third parties. Emotions of the whole nation are affected like riding on the roller coasters, let alone the relatives.</p>

<p>The latest news, came unexpectedly without any warmth of humanity. A text message sending to relatives of the passengers onboard says that &ldquo;we have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those onboard survived.&rdquo; Maybe the planes was ended in the remote Southern Indian Ocean for it is &ldquo;far from any possible landing sites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cannot imagine those relatives' heartbreak.</p>

<p>Lives are so fragile that any good bye would become a farewell forever.</p>

<p>Please pray for the living, and mourn over the passing. Cherish every single moment sharing with your beloved. Treat life well.</p>

<p><em>About Time</em> is a movie telling a young man could travel in time back to anytime in his own life changing what happens and what has happened.<!--more--></p>

<p>Well, if I am asked what could I change if I have such ability, what would I answer?</p>

<p>I have no idea.</p>

<p>Since the &ldquo;disappearance&rdquo; of the flight MH370, there would be more than 18 hours. Presume you would be a passenger on board, do you regret if it&rsquo;s the end of your life? Or suppose you&rsquo;re a relative/friend of someone on board, what do you think?</p>

<p>Useless anger in burst or refusal dinner with beloved?</p>

<p>So sorry that there would be no more chances for you. Actually, Lives are so fragile that &ldquo;Death could not be anticipated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just one moment, passing-aways are insulated from fresh lives. It&rsquo;s so quick beyond your response.</p>

<p>We are not the hero in that movie who could travel in time, we could be too helpless to change even a flash of time.</p>

<p>Please, living in the present, there would be even no opportunity for regretting.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> Let&rsquo;s pray, for the best of those lost brothers and sisters.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天上午，參加大連春季招聘會，未有合適崗位可應聘。午飯和下午與摯友聚會，暢談關於現狀，關於未來。</p>

<p>將所聊的脈絡、思維點滴記錄如下：</p>

<ol>
<li><p>即將而立之年，可轉行，前提是所轉行業、方向對於自己有持續性(持久性)，需以事業(開拓)而非工作(餬口)之心面對；若非如此，需以已有經驗爲依託繼續深入，不可浮躁變換目標。</p></li>
<li><p>尋求可持續發展之道，至少使得自己(家人)的生活水平維持現狀(單身時期)。考慮年工資水平與漲幅、物價水平與漲幅、未來因組建家庭等原因的消費支出以及其他各方面因素，所選職業方向是否能夠完成上述目標。</p></li>
<li><p>尋求揚長避短的發展軌跡，考慮自身的絕對優勢與相對優勢(參考<a href="http://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E7%BB%9D%E5%AF%B9%E4%BC%98%E5%8A%BF%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA">絕對優勢理論</a>)，選擇最適合自己的職業方向。</p></li>
<li><p>針對現狀，或者投資有較高回報率和持續性的項目，或者投資自身——MBA、研究生或其他，努力擴大自己的視野、思考高度和人際關係高度。<!--more--></p></li>
<li><p>原始積累的獲取最為困難，如何借助外力，彼此協助，取得進展。</p></li>
<li><p>創業優先，就業其次。</p></li>
<li><p>不可急躁，不可輕易放棄；機遇若來，努力抓住；機遇未來，盡心準備。</p></li>
<li><p>最為可貴，在於知道自己想要什麼，正在做什麼，怎麼改變，怎麼改善。</p></li>
<li><p>正業副業並不矛盾，相互轉化，關鍵在於戰略性思考。</p></li>
<li><p>小心計劃，大膽嘗試，決斷方向，解決細節，不懼失敗，步步為營。</p></li>
<li><p>多看書，獨立、主動、批判性思考。</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be.</p>

<p>Most things in the life seem to be predestined. Emotion, fortunes, jobs&hellip; No idea when it would burst into your life rather than when it would be going to vanish.<!--more--></p>

<p>You are always desperate and hopeless when you are insulated from love or career you urgently desired days and nights.</p>

<p>Hallucination comes then, talks to yourself you are abandoned. Your doubt the Lord leaves you uncared even omitted.</p>

<p>Some grieving emotions aroused as patients are told to face with impending death &mdash; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Maybe the stages evolves faster than the instance, however, someone are so easy to fall into the abyss of self-denial (rather than condition-denial) and
 accept you yourself are indeed a loser afterwards giving up even not trying once again.</p>

<p>Actually, the period is for you to rest, retrospect, think, and be improved. The best strategy is getting armed, with everything you could access to, to enrich yourself.</p>

<p>Just like the saying &ldquo;Opportunity favors only the prepared mind&rdquo;. Not to emphasize you would surely get the chance when prepared. Instead, a prepared one is easier to grasp the fortune.</p>

<p>Watching the videos <em>Paul Potts</em> and <em>Susan Boyle</em> of <em>Britain&rsquo;s Talent Show</em> again, undoubtedly bursting into tears another time. No one is easy to impress others.</p>

<p>Getting prepared and showing, the whole world would make way for you. Besides, don&rsquo;t let the passing time agitated you referring to the conception of “sunk cost”.</p>

<p>Well, be a man, and you will enjoy it! So, if it&rsquo;s meant to be, it will be, only when you are prepared.</p>

<p><strong>It becomes a torture which the state between-jobs' lasting more than four months.</strong></p>

<p>Retrospecting my travel itinerary last year from Thai to South Korea, nearly 50 days across eight countries and districts, I know, traveling is indispensable in my life notwithstanding being not the life itself.<!--more--></p>

<p>Actually, I love challenges no matter in travel or in daily life, especially from emotions and work. The point is that future is worth expecting and exploring.</p>

<p>Watching kinds of TV series, reading books, reviewing English vocabularies, learning Python, celebrating Chinese Spring Festival&hellip; I might feel a hallucination of time&rsquo;s fleeing.</p>

<p>So a new spring has come already.</p>

<p>I believe I am lost, in a deserted corner of the world.</p>

<p>Though it feels no worse, please cheer up! I urgently need a fresh air and a breakthrough.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong><br/>
Happy Lantern Festival and single&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day!</p>
